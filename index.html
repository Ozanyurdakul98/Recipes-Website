        <h1>My favourite Recipe</h1>
        <p>This Recipe is the one i cooked the most during my studies at Justus-Liebig-University in Gie√üen, Germany.
            I highly recommend this recipe for the purpose of a tasteful explosion of flavours in your mouth and a bigger wallet.
            In Addition to the eggs, you should go with 2 slices of good bred.

        <h3>What you'll need:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>pan</strong></li>
            <li>4 <strong>eggs</strong></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of <strong>coconut oil</strong></li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons of <strong>salt</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 <strong>red pepper</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons of <strong>red pepper and garlic</strong> powder</li>
            <li>2 cloves of <strong>garlic</strong></li>
            <li>1 <strong>big tomato</strong></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Valuable egg recommendation:</h3>
        <p>I don't know why, but white eggs taste a lot better than brown eggs. Try it out!</p>
