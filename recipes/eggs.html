        <h1>My favourite Recipe</h1>
        <h2>Eggs in pan</h2>


        <p>This Recipe is the one i cooked the most during my studies at Justus-Liebig-University in Gie√üen, Germany.
            I highly recommend this recipe for the purpose of a tasteful explosion of flavours in your mouth and a bigger wallet.
            Also you have your dinner ready in no time.
            In Addition to the eggs, you should go with 2 slices of good bred.
